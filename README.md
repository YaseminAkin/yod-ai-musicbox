A music education application that converts music sheets to voice and tabs. Our project is a web application that reads musical notes from music sheet paper and processes them to provide sound playback, giving real-time guidance on playing musical instruments. Our application uses an advanced Optical Music Recognition (OMR) feature, using OpenCV to preprocess the sheet music and use open source external libraries like Oemer. Recognized notes are converted into the MIDI format and synthesized into sound using open source external libraries called MuseScore and FluidSynth. Our high-level execution plan will preprocess the image, identify notes, and synthesize sound. This project integrates the fields of computer vision and machine learning to make an interactive, fun, and educational tool in the process of learning music. Additionally, we plan to demonstrate to users how to play the specified note sheet on the piano virtually.
